plot-summary:
  In the aftermath of the failed Bay of Pigs invasion, a group of agents at the CIA hatch a plot to attempt an assassination of President Kennedy and blame it on the Cuban government. Several different factions are involved in the conspiracy and working more or less independently. One faction recruits Cuban exiles, while another settles on Lee Harvey Oswald, a former Marine who defected to the Soviet Union for several years before returning to Texas. At some point, it is decided to actually kill Kennedy rather than missing.

  In the event, Oswald and the Cubans both hit President Kennedy. Oswald is arrested and is himself murdered several days later by Jack Ruby, who was manipulated into doing it by members of the conspiracy. The chapters of the book alternate between Oswald's and various conspirator's perspectives.
